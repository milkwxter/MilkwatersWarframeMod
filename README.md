Enjoy new weapons and armor, crafted with new components, while fighting the new Grineer faction!

Current list of all things added by this mod below:

[b]Weapons:[/b]
All weapons have custom sounds, and some even have special effects, such as a new projectile, alternate firing modes, or inducing a custom effect on the pawn that was hit! (For example, an infested weapon will give Toxic Buildup!)

[b]Armor:[/b]
Grineer space marine helmet
Corpus crewman helmet
Grineer space marine armor

[b]Creatures:[/b]
Underbrush kubrow
Robot Moa

[b]Other items:[/b]
Prime parts
Wraith components
Prisma crystals
Vandal salvage
Kuva drops
Tenet circuits
Kubrow eggs

[b]Factions:[/b]
Grineer (very hostile, will swarm you with many weaker soldiers)
Corpus (also very hostile, will use lasers and Moa robots to overwhelm you)
Steel Meridian (friendly, they will sell grineer related items in the future)

[b]Xenotypes:[/b]
Grineer (low maintenence soldiers, good for overwhelming your enemies)

[h1]What does the future hold?[/h1]
I plan to update this a lot with cool new features.
I think I will work on adding a custom trade table for the Steel Meridian, including wraith components and Vaykor weapons.
After this I might work on adding a workbench that can craft all the Warframe stuff instead of using the machining table.

[h1]FAQ[/h1]
[b]Why does this require Biotech?[/b]
- I use the Beam Grazer code for the Nukor, and I also included a custom xenotype for the Grineer. Eventually I want to disable these items when Biotech DLC is not detected so everyone can enjoy the mod.
